# odin-resturant

This project was created as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum (see here)[https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page]. It provides a chance to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a resturant home page. All of the content on the site is generated using javascript.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/wolfSkullCave/odin-resturant.git`
   `cd odin-resturant`

2. Build/Run:
   `npx webpack`
   `npx webpack serve`

## What you get

- A simple javascript website where all the content is generated via DOM code.
- Simple, readable structure- ease to tweak and extend.
